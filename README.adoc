= portfolio1 project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

== Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

== Packaging and running the application

The application is packageable using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the executable `portfolio1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/portfolio1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

== Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or you can use Docker to build the native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

You can then execute your binary: `./target/portfolio1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide .

== Portfolio1
I am building an application to keep track of a stock portfolio. This has an Angular front-end with a REST services back-end implemented
with Quarkus.
The features of the first version:
- manually add/remove stocks
- retrieve latest prices from Yahoo Finance

This is the architecture of the application:

=== Project setup
Let us start with an empty project by specifying the extensions on https://code.quarkus.io and download the resulting zip.
The necessary extension:
- RESTeasy JAX-R
- RESTeasy JSON-B

To make sure the development environment works, you start the development mode:
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----

In your browser, enter http://localhost:8080/hello and you will see "hello" as a response.

=== Add Yahoo finance API dependency
The retrieve the latest stock price, I add this dependency:
----
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.yahoofinance-api</groupId>
    <artifactId>YahooFinanceAPI</artifactId>
    <version>3.15.0</version>
  </dependency>
----

To get the stock information, including price:
----
Stock stock = YahooFinance.get(symbol);
----

=== Stock REST resource
It will be necessary get the latest stock price through a REST service, so we add the StockResource:

----
  @Path("/{symbol}/latestPrice")
  @GET
  public Response stock(@PathParam("symbol") String symbol) throws IOException {
    Stock stock = YahooFinance.get(symbol);

    Response response = null;
    if (stock == null) {
      response = Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    } else {
      StockLatestPriceResponse stockResponse = new StockLatestPriceResponse(stock.getSymbol(), stock.getQuote().getPrice());
      response = Response.ok(stockResponse).build();
    }
    return response;
  }
----

We can test this by accessing this URL: http://localhost:8080/stocks/AAPL/latestPrice

=== Angular front-end
